## ðŸ“– About the project

This project is a **Pokemon battle game** where players can select their Pokemon and engage in strategic battles. It uses a specific algorithm to determine the winner based on the Pokemon's stats.

## ðŸ§  Battle Algorithm

- The Pokemon with the highest speed attacks first. If their speeds are equal, the Pokemon with the higher attack goes first.
- To calculate damage, subtract the defense from the attack (attack - defense). The difference is the damage. If the attack is equal to or less than the defense, the damage is 1.
- Subtract the damage from the HP.
- The Pokemon will take turns fighting. All turns will be calculated in the same request, so the endpoint must return the winner's data in the same call.
- The winner is the one who reduces the opponent's HP to zero.
- The type system has been implemented but it does not interact with the battle algorithm, it is only visual.
